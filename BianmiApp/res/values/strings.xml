    <string name="str_about_9gag">9GAG, Inc., is a social media website whereby users upload and share user-generated images, videos, and GIFs. The website\'s content, generally referred to as "internet memes" or "internet jokes", is upvoted, downvoted, and commented on by users based on its popularity at a given time.\nSince the website\'s founding in 2008 by Hong Kong entrepreneurs Chris Chan, Ray Chan, Derek Chan, Brian Yu, and Marco Fung, it has grown in popularity, currently having over 9 million Facebook “likes” and 2.4 million Twitter followers. Since 2008 the number of unique global monthly website visitors has also increased from 500,000 to 67 million.\n9GAG users have also commonly re-posted (without any consent from its respective authors) content found on other humor related websites like 4chan, FunnyJunk, Newgrounds, Reddit, SomethingAwful, and YTMND, often with a 9GAG watermark. In 2011, 9GAG and 4chan disputed authorship of internet memes published on both websites, whereby each company claimed the memes originated in their own website. Evidence seems to support 4chan\'s claim that most of the disputed content was created by 4chan users. As stated by 9GAG co-founder Ray Chan, "9GAG does not create memes or rage comics, but helps spread them." 9GAG also adopted 4chan\'s "legion" and “hearth of the internet” nicknames.\nFollowing these controversies, 4chan retaliated in 2011 by uploading large amounts of obscene content like pornography and gore onto 9GAG. While moderators were able to delete some of the spam content, the obscene posts were uploaded constantly for over 40 hours, and soon after 4chan began a series of DDOS attacks that made 9GAG inaccessible for many users.</string>
